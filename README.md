1. Download Repository from Releases (make sure it says latest)
2. Extract the Zip Archive
3. Remove **Materials.html** or **Materials-dark.html** for dark theme and place it in a spot where you won't lose it
4. Rename the file to the name of your choosing and delete its old parent folder
5. Make sure to check for updates because unlike the webpage the file does'nt automatically update
